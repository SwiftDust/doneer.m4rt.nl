This is a donation website for a journey I'm making in 2027 to the municipality of Kgetlengrivier, South Africa. I've made this myself using Astro, Tailwind and sprinkled in a bit of Shadcn/ui. Hope you like it!

I used a bit of AI (Copilot and Cursor) to help me fix gnarly bugs and ship faster. Especially the i18n part used AI because there was a library that did not work like expected and I had to find another one, Cursor helped me with that.
