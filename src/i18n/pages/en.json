I'm Mart, fifteen years old and in 2027 I'm going to South Africa with an organization called <a href=\"https://shib.nl\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary-light underline\">Shib</a> to help people there, repair shacks and build new buildings like a daycare. If you want more information, feel free to look on Shib's <a href=\"https://shib.nl\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary-light underline\">website</a>. I need â‚¬ 3000 (~ $3500) for this journey and that's a pretty daunting task. That's why we do a lot of actions with the South-Africa group to raise money. But spontaneous donations work, too! This website, which I've designed and programmed myself, is also one of the ways to raise money for me.",
